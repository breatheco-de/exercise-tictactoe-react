## üå±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository! We will be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react.js boilerplate`, using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can [clone the GitHub repository](https://4geeks.com/how-to/github-clone-repository) on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
```

üí° Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.

## üìù Instructions

Create a Tictactoe in React.js just like [this one](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-tictactoe-react/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true). Remember to follow the recommended workflow to start coding:

1. Design your sitemap: How many pages/views?
2. Designing your wireframe: What components and where?
3. Start coding your components only rendering "Hello world" on each of them (to make sure they work).
4. Create a list of all the possible user and system interactions (events) that occurs during runtime (for example: The user clicks on a button to start the game)
6. Create a javascript function that will handle each of those events.
7. `Console.log` on each of those functions to make sure they are being called.
9. Continue... watch the video if you have any other doubts.

### Concepts you will learn:

- State of the components (global variables)
- Props
- Render method
- The function for checking the winner is a great learning algorithm

### Video Tutorial:
